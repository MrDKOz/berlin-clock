# [Code Kata] Berlin Clock

The Berlin Clock is a clock that tells time using a series of illuminated coloured blocks, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengenlehreuhr).

I used [this](https://www.agilekatas.co.uk/katas/BerlinClock-Kata) page as a reference for the kata.
